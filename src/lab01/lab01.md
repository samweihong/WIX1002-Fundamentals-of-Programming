# Lab 1 Sample Solutions

## Q1

Q1 is not included since it is just a tutorial video.

## Q2 `MyProfile.java` and `Q2.jar`

If you are using Java 15 or above, you also can try the alternate solution named `MyProfileAlternative.java`.
It uses text blocks declared by `"""` (three double quote marks) to indicate a multiline string.

## Q3 `Q3.java`

You may check out the `Q3OOP.java` for an OOP approach.

## Q4 `Q4.java`

You can experiment with the `Q4Bar.java`, `Q4Line.java`, and `Q4Pie.java` files that implement GUI using Java Swing.
That is to say, you don't need to install any extra libraries like JavaFX because Swing is already included in your
Java SDK.

## Q5

Q5 is not included as it is also a tutorial video.
