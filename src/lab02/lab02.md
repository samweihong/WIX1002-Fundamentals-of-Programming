# Lab 2 Sample Solutions

## Q1 `Q1.java`

## Q2 `Q2.java`

## Q3 `Q3.java`

## Q4 `Q4.java`

You may check out `Q4For.java` which uses a `for` loop to increment the number of hours and minutes.
However, it is an inefficient solution if you know math.

## Q5 `Q5.java`

- `Q5.java` first obtains the first, second, ..., last digits in sequence and sums them up.
- `Q5Back.java` does the opposite: it obtains the last, second last, ..., first digits in sequence and sum
  them up.
- `Q5BackFor.java` uses a simple `for` loop to describe the looping process in `Q5Back.java`.
- `Q5String.java` converts the number to a string, and then accesses each character (digit) for the summing.
- `Q5StringFor.java` uses a `for` loop to simplify `Q5String.java` without the need to check the length of the string
  before accessing each character.

## Q6 `Q6.java`
