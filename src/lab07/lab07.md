## Q2 `Q2.java`

## Q3 `Q3.java`

## Q4 `Q4.java`

## Q5 `Q5.java`

- `Q5.java` uses bubble sort by comparing the names in the `name` array and swapping the entries in all three
  arrays: `name`, `age`, and `gender`.
- `Q5Index.java` uses an `index` array to refer to the indexes of each person's information in the three arrays. Then,
  it sorts the array based on the names the indexes refer to.
- `Q5ArrayBubbleSort.java` stores all the people's information in a two-dimensional `String` array and sorts it
  according to the names.
- `Q5ArrayJavaSort.java` does the same as `Q5ArrayBubbleSort.java` but sorts the array using Java's `Arrays.sort`
  method with a custom comparator.
